# Facial Expression Recognition using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques 😄😢😡😱

## 📝 Introduction
In today's digital age, understanding human emotions from visual cues has become increasingly important in various applications such as human-computer interaction, affective computing, and psychological research. Recognizing emotions from facial expressions is a challenging yet crucial task with numerous real-world applications. 

This project aims to develop a robust system for **Facial Expression Recognition** using **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques. Our goal is to accurately detect and classify emotions depicted in images, such as **happiness**, **sadness**, **anger**, **surprise**, **fear**, **disgust**, and **contempt**.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Preprocessing**: Standardizing images (grayscale, histogram equalization, Gaussian blurring) to enhance quality and reduce noise.
2. **Model Exploration**: Training traditional models (SVM, Random Forest) and Deep Learning models (CNN).
3. **Unsupervised Learning**: Using **K-Means clustering** to analyze facial expression patterns.

By leveraging these approaches, our system aims to recognize emotions from facial expressions, with implications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, healthcare, and more. 🚀

## 📊 Dataset – Preprocessing – Augmentation
### Dataset 📸
The dataset consists of images depicting various facial expressions paired with emotion labels. The expressions cover emotions like **happiness**, **sadness**, **anger**, **surprise**, **fear**, **disgust**, and sometimes **contempt**. These images span across different demographics, ensuring representativeness.

### Preprocessing 🧑‍💻
Before training models, we preprocess the dataset to:
- **Convert to grayscale** for simplicity.
- **Apply histogram equalization** to enhance contrast.
- **Resize images** (e.g., 48x48 pixels).
- **Normalize pixel values** to a range between 0 and 1.

### Augmentation 🔄
We apply **data augmentation** techniques such as rotation, translation, scaling, and flipping to:
- Increase dataset variety.
- Prevent overfitting.
- Improve the model’s ability to recognize emotions in different poses and lighting conditions.
